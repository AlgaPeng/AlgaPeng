## Welcome to Alga's Page

I am a Master's student at Cornell Univerisity studying Electrical and Computer Engineering. I recently with my bachelor's degree at Cornell Univerisity in ECE and a minor in CS. My study of focus is on ASIC design and verification, and embedded systems' design. I am looking for full-time opportunities starting June 2023.

### RESEARCH EXPERIENCE
#### Cornell Computer Systems Laboratory, in [HeteroCL](https://heterocl.csl.cornell.edu/) group with [Prof. Zhiru Zhang](https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/faculty-directory/zhiru-zhang)
- Implemented, tested, and optimized image processing algorithms (Sobel edge, Canny edge) using high-level synthesis
-	Built support for vector data type and vectorization primitives on a new high-level synthesis tool (HeteroCL)
-	Developed test cases and verified reuse buffer and multi-dimensional vectorization features
-	Created a general user tutorial for HeteroCL new developers

#### Paper Publication, Parallel Programming Research Seminar with [Prof. Rakesh Kumar](https://ece.illinois.edu/about/directory/faculty/rakeshk)
- Projects working on different programming models including OpenMP, MPI, and CUDA.
- Carried out a research paper introduces three new parallel genetic algorithms–Master-Slave model, Coarse-Grained model, and a Combined version–to optimize performance for the Travelling Salesman Problem.
- Publication on “The 2nd International Conference on Automation Control, Algorithm and Intelligent Bionics(ACAIB 2022)” with title “Parallel Genetic Algorithm for Travelling Salesman Problem”

### PROJECT EXPERIENCE
#### Microcontroller Development and Design Projects 
- [ECE 4760](https://people.ece.cornell.edu/land/courses/ece4760/) -- Project [PIC32MX](https://people.ece.cornell.edu/land/courses/ece4760/FinalProjects/f2021/cp444_xz598/cp444_xz598/index.html): Built an arcade for rhythm game using Direct Digital Synthesis to generate sounds, potentiometers to detect motions on handmade wooden piano keys, PiTFT to display game, and keyboard to take in user inputs. 
- [ECE 5725](https://skovira.ece.cornell.edu/ece5725/) -- Project [Raspberry Pi 4](https://courses.ece.cornell.edu/ece5990/ECE5725_Spring2021_Projects/May_17/Hand%20Held%20Game/ECE%205725%20Web/index.html): Created a multiplayer multilevel prey-and-predator game on RPi 4, using PyGame module for animation, external buttons for user controls, and PiTFT touch screen for user interface display.
- [ECE 3400](https://courses.cornell.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=31&coid=491066) -- Project [Arduino NANO Every](https://pages.github.coecis.cornell.edu/cp444/ECE3400/): Built a robot car that supports instantaneous speed and direction changes based on light 
intensity and position using photosensor, and obstacle detection using Ultrasonic sensor.
- [ECE 3140](https://cornellcswiki.gitlab.io/classes/CS3420.html) -- Project [FRDM-K64F](https://pages.github.coecis.cornell.edu/ece3140-sp2020/cp444-sh2429/): Constructed a 3D distance measurement tool using accelerometer, FXOS8700 6-Axes Sensor, and PuTTY for velocity detection, position detection, and data display correspondingly. It is a multi-process concurrent program which includes start, select, and interrupt processing written in C and assembly language.
