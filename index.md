## Welcome to Alga's Page

I'm an ECE undergraduate student at Cornell University starting from 2018.

### RESEARCH EXPERIENCE
#### Cornell Computer Systems Laboratory, in [HeteroCL](https://heterocl.csl.cornell.edu/) group with [Prof. Zhiru Zhang](https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/faculty-directory/zhiru-zhang)
- Created a general user tutorial for HCL new developers; Tested and optimized Sobel edge and Canny edge using 
HCL; Supported customization primitives on HCL such as vector data type and vectorization for VHLS.
- Developed test cases for reuse buffer and vectorization on multi-dimensional arrays, practiced verifying the 
generated VHLS code using the Vivado HLS

#### Paper Publication, Parallel Programming Research Seminar with [Prof. Rakesh Kumar](https://ece.illinois.edu/about/directory/faculty/rakeshk)
- Projects working on different programming models including OpenMP, MPI, and CUDA.
- Carried out a research paper introduces three new parallel genetic algorithms–Master-Slave model, Coarse-Grained model, and a Combined version–to optimize performance for the Travelling Salesman Problem.
- Publication on “The 2nd International Conference on Automation Control, Algorithm and Intelligent Bionics(ACAIB 2022)” with title “Parallel Genetic Algorithm for Travelling Salesman Problem”

### PROJECT EXPERIENCE
#### Microcontroller Development and Design Projects 
- [ECE 4760](https://people.ece.cornell.edu/land/courses/ece4760/) -- Project [PIC32MX](https://people.ece.cornell.edu/land/courses/ece4760/FinalProjects/f2021/cp444_xz598/cp444_xz598/index.html): Built an arcade for rhythm game using Direct Digital Synthesis to generate sounds, potentiometers to detect motions on handmade wooden piano keys, PiTFT to display game, and keyboard to take in user inputs. 
- [ECE 5725](https://skovira.ece.cornell.edu/ece5725/) -- Project [Raspberry Pi 4](https://courses.ece.cornell.edu/ece5990/ECE5725_Spring2021_Projects/May_17/Hand%20Held%20Game/ECE%205725%20Web/index.html): Created a multiplayer multilevel prey-and-predator game on RPi 4, using PyGame module for animation, external buttons for user controls, and PiTFT touch screen for user interface display.
- [ECE 3400](https://courses.cornell.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=31&coid=491066) -- Project [Arduino NANO Every](https://pages.github.coecis.cornell.edu/cp444/ECE3400/): Built a robot car that supports instantaneous speed and direction changes based on light 
intensity and position using photosensor, and obstacle detection using Ultrasonic sensor.
- [ECE 3140](https://cornellcswiki.gitlab.io/classes/CS3420.html) -- Project [FRDM-K64F](https://pages.github.coecis.cornell.edu/ece3140-sp2020/cp444-sh2429/): Constructed a 3D distance measurement tool using accelerometer, FXOS8700 6-Axes Sensor, and PuTTY for velocity detection, position detection, and data display correspondingly. It is a multi-process concurrent program which includes start, select, and interrupt processing written in C and assembly language.
